The accepted papers are linked on the [Accepted Papers page](../accepted). Video presentations of all papers will be available through underline.io.

We will have a two-hour virtual meeting, via Zoom, on May 10, 2020, at 11 am UTC.
The Zoom link will be sent to all participants via email before the meeting time.
The agenda for the virtual meeting is below.

In the first hour, we invite the authors of each accepted paper to present for 3-5 minutes on the
topic, "The role of multi-agent-based simulation in addressing global problems".

In the second hour, we will have a general discussion, centered broadly on the same topic.
